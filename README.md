# Virtual Shifting 

This repository implements an HID device for the [Virtual Shifting project](https://www.hackster.io/jmlopezdona/virtual-shifting-for-everyone-43a90a).

Development is based on the following Espressif example repositories:
- [ble_hid_device_demo](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/bluetooth/bluedroid/ble/ble_hid_device_demo) Note: I had to use the master branch version because the last stable version is not compatible with Android 13 version
- [button_power_save](https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution/tree/master/examples/get-started/button_power_save)

# Build & Flash

Building and flashing this project is the same as with other projects based on the IDF-ESP framework. 
Please review this [link](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started); if you are able to build and flash the getting started example, you can do the same with this code. :-)
