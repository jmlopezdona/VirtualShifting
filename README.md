# Virtual Shifting 

This repository implement a HID device to [Virtual Shifting project](https://www.hackster.io/jmlopezdona/virtual-shifting-for-everyone-43a90a).

Development is based on this Espressif examples repositories:
- [ble_hid_device_demo](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/bluetooth/bluedroid/ble/ble_hid_device_demo) Note: I had to use the master branch version because the last stable version is not compatible with Android 13 version
- [button_power_save](https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution/tree/master/examples/get-started/button_power_save)
